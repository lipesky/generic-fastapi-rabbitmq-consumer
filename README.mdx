# Generic Fastapi/RabbitMQ Consumer Server


This repository holds the code for a blank consumer microservice that uses patio, rabbitmq in an async approach to handle requests and distributes to processing microsservices in request-reply approach, with distributed rpc calls thanks to patio.

You can use this as basis for other microservices.

The example sends consumes requests queued by [Generic Gateway](https://github.com/lipesky/generic-fastapi-rabbitmq-gateway)



Pull requests are welcome.
